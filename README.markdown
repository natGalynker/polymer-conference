## The Topic

I chose to do research on Google's new technology called Polymer. It has been
around for a few years. It takes a lot of the technologies which a variety of
frameworks use and puts it in the hands of web developers. This means that
instead of getting a new set of rules at every turn, it allows all the different
frameworks to do the same thing without having to learn a different language or
framework when a developer wants to use it. When I first started doing research
for it I didn't really understand how expanisive it was. However after doing
research the possibilities that it holds reaclly keeps expanding. I hope that in
actuality they were able to pull it off.
